[Everything I wish I knew when learning C (tmewett.com)](https://tmewett.com/c-tips/)


These weren't mentioned in the post but have been very helpful in my journey as a C beginner so far:

- Effective C by Robert C. Seacord. It covers a lot of the footguns and gotchas without assuming too much systems or comp-sci background knowledge. https://nostarch.com/Effective_C (Also, how can you not buy a book on C with Cthulhu on the cover written by a guy with _three_ “C”s in his name?)

- Tiny C Projects by Dan Gookin, for a “learn by doing” approach. https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-c-projects

- Exercism's C language track: https://exercism.org/tracks/c

- Computer Systems, A Programmer's Perspective by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron for a deeper dive into memory, caches, networking, concurrency and more using C, with plenty of practice problems: https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/
